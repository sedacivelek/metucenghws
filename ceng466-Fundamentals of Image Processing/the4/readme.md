# Question 1

Question 1 is implemented via Matlab. There are two related files which are final_q1 and q1_generic. final_q1 file is used for testing different image inputs. q1_generic contains the implementation of the algorithm. 

## How to run 
You can use final_q1 to add new test inputs and run them. It saves corresponding outputs to the "q1output" folder. 

# Question 2

Question 2 is implemented via Python. There are one python file which is final_q2. In this part scikit-learn library is used.
## Installation

```bash
pip install -U scikit-learn
```

## How to run 
```bash
python3 inputfile outputfolder 
```
You can the following command to get output of image1.png as example:
```bash
python3 Dataset2/1.png q2output 
```

# Question 3 
Question 3 is implemented via Matlab. There are two related files which are final_q3 and q3_generic. final_q3 file is used for testing different image inputs. q3_generic contains the implementation of the algorithm.

## How to run 
You can use final_q3 to add new test inputs and run them. It saves corresponding outputs to the "q3output" folder.
